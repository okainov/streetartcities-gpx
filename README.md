# üó∫Ô∏è streetartcities ‚Üí GPX Converter

A simple command-line tool to convert one or more JSON files (or URLs) into a single [GPX 1.1](https://www.topografix.com/gpx.asp) file with properly formatted waypoints.

It‚Äôs ideal for datasets from Street Art Cities website which you can get the following structure from:

```json
{
  "@type": "Response",
  "status": 200,
  "items": [
    {
      "id": "2754",
      "location": {
        "lat": 48.1426714,
        "lng": 11.5361956,
        "address": "Donnersbergerbr√ºcke, M√ºnchen, Deutschland"
      },
      "marker": "https://streetart.media/2/markers/2754.png",
      "siteId": "munich",
      "type": "artwork",
      "status": "active",
      "title": "Untitled",
      "href": "https://streetartcities.com/cities/munich/markers/2754"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Usage

- While browsing streetartcities.com note requests to `markers.json` files, URLs like `https://streetartcities.com/data/zones/1810/markers.json`.
- Run the script with one or more URLs as parameter:

```bash
python streetartcities2gpx.py https://streetartcities.com/data/zones/1910/markers.json https://streetartcities.com/data/zones/2010/markers.json https://streetartcities.com/data/zones/1809/markers.json https://streetartcities.com/data/zones/1810/markers.json
```
- You should see output like `‚úÖ Saved GPX to C:\Users\User\Documents\markers_merged.gpx  (waypoints: 3432)`

Script performs automatic de-duplication of points, so multiple files/URLs can be safely passed multiple times.

- But also, check out [Mural.place](https://mural.place) which is a newly launched *open* map of street arts and murals where everyone can contribute! Thanks!
